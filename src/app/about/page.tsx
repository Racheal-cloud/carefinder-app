        <Text fontSize="lg">
          CarefinderPro is a platform designed to help users find, export, and share information about hospitals within their region in Nigeria. Our vision at CareFinder is to become the preeminent search engine for care homes. We go beyond simply narrowing down options based on the criteria provided. We pledge to build and use data analytics that have been underutilised in the sector, to serve a market that has been underfunded and largely ignored for decades. Our mission is to make the process of finding the ideal care home for loved ones as easy and stress-free as possible. We strive to provide the best, most accurate information and resources to help families make informed decisions about the care of their loved ones.
